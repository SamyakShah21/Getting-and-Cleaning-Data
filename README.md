__Dataset used:__ [Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).<br>
## Files: <br>
1. __CodeBook.md:__ a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data. <br>
2. __FinalData.txt:__ the exported final data after going through all the sequences undertaken in run_analysis.R.<br>
3. __run_analysis.R:__ performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:<br>
    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    - Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
